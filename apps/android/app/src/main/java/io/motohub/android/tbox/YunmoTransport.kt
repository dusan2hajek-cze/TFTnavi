/**
 * Yunmo :8200 SoftAP projection transport (Moto Morini X-Cape 1200 and any dash sharing that
 * wire). Unlike EasyConn there is nothing to discover — the SoftAP is already joined and the dash
 * always answers on `192.168.4.1:8200` — so [discover] just names the host and all the real work
 * happens in [start]: open the socket, ask the dash for its canvas size, tell it to start, and
 * emit the negotiated [TBoxEvent.VideoArea] the session encoder is then configured from.
 *
 * The dash reports its real canvas and the emitted area is that size (see
 * [YunmoProtocol.encodeCanvas], which documents the doubling this used to do and why it was
 * wrong); when the dash never answers the size query, the profile's
 * [TBoxModelProfile.fallbackTBoxVideoArea] backstops it. Frame metadata is deliberately kept off
 * the wire ([YunmoProtocol.encodeH264Ex] `omitMeta`), matching the only build known to render.
 *
 * [answersOnThisLink] lets the EasyConn path hand a session over when a dash turns out to speak
 * Yunmo, so reaching this transport does not depend on the rider having found a profile override.
 *
 * See [YunmoProtocol] for the byte format and the memory note `reference-yunmo-8200-protocol`.
